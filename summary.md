# Elm and the Elm architecture, dramatically simpler GUI programming.
We will introduce Elm, a language for building applications in the browser. The
focus of the language is to make it easier to build complex graphical user
interfaces.


# Describing Elm, identifying the important characteristics of Elm
* Purely Functional
* Functional Reactive Programming, representing values that change over time 
* Declaritive (see 01_what_is_high_level, i.e. only the essential need be
  provided/communicated to solve a problem)


# Arguments in favour of Static Typing
* dynamic typing fatigue
* refactoring
* "No more runtime errors"*
* types are a language for expressing high level design
* types communicate programmer intent
* CAVEAT: type systems need to be expressive enough to allow the programmer to
  represent common programming tasks

## Misc
* [Cpp Andrei Alexandrescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIb3L4vKZ7U) If you
shoot for composition, the code almost writes itself.
