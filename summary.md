# Elm - An introduction
Why elm?
web apps
complex, rich interactive GUIs

We will introduce Elm, a language for building applications in the browser. The
focus of the language is making it easier to build complex graphical user
interfaces by introducing language constructs that are able to model the apsects
of GUIs. 

Elm and the Elm architecture, dramatically simpler GUI programming.

# Describing Elm, identifying the important characteristics of Elm
* Pure Functional, referenctially transparent?, equational reasoning
* Functional Reactive Programming (Signals, Behaviours, Time -> a, time varying
  values)
* Declaritive (see 01_what_is_high_level, i.e. only the essential need be
  provided/communicated to solve a problem)
* ? A domains specific language for describing interactive programs


# Arguments in favour of Static Typing
* dynamic typing fatigue
* refactoring
* types for high level design and reasoning
* types represent programmer intent
* acknowledgment that type systems and language need to be expressive enough to
  allow the expression of enough patterns that programmers wish to express.
