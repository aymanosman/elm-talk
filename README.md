# Elm Talk
First you need to [install Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install).
If you have npm, it's as easy as `npm install -g elm`.

When you are done you will have the following binaries in your path that we will
make use of:
- elm-package
- elm-make
- elm-reactor

Run `elm-reactor --port 8000` in this folder and go to http://localhost:8000 to have an Elm
environment up and running.

When you are starting out [http://elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) is a great place to experiment.
